# The Character Sheet: A Guide to Knowing Yourself

---

## Welcome, Player

You've been playing the most complex game ever designed for your entire life. It has no tutorial, no pause button, and the rules keep changing. The stakes are as real as it gets. And yet, most of us have never stopped to look at our character sheet.

This is your invitation to do exactly that.

The Character Sheet is a structured self-reflection tool — a way to take an honest, clear-eyed look at who you are right now across the dimensions that matter most. It borrows its structure from tabletop role-playing games, where every character is defined by a set of core attributes and a collection of learned abilities. The difference is that here, the character is you, and the numbers aren't random — they come from your own honest assessment of your life as it stands today.

This isn't a personality test. It won't tell you what type you are or sort you into a category. It's a snapshot — a portrait of your life across eight fundamental dimensions, scored on a simple 1–20 scale. Some of what you see will make you proud. Some of it might be uncomfortable. All of it is useful.

The Character Sheet was designed with the rigour of psychological science and the wisdom of game design. It takes seriously the idea that if you want to grow, you first need to know where you stand. Not where you think you stand. Not where you wish you stood. Where you actually are, right now, today.

So take your time. Be honest. There are no right answers and no one is grading you. This sheet is for you alone — unless you choose to share it.

Let's begin.

## The Infinite Game

There are two kinds of games. Finite games have fixed rules, clear boundaries, and a definitive winner. Chess. Football. An exam. You play to win, and then the game is over.

Life is not a finite game.

Life is what James Carse called an infinite game — one played not to win, but to keep playing. The purpose of an infinite game is to sustain the play itself, to bring in new players, to ensure the game continues. There is no final score, no championship trophy, no moment where you can declare victory and walk away.

The Character Sheet is built on this understanding. You are not trying to max out your stats. You are not competing with anyone — not even a previous version of yourself. You are trying to play well, for as long as you can, in a way that sustains the game for you and the people you share it with.

This changes how you read your scores. A finite player looks at a low number and thinks: *I need to fix this.* An infinite player looks at a low number and thinks: *What is this telling me about how I'm playing?* Sometimes a low score is a problem that needs attention. Sometimes it's the natural cost of investing deeply somewhere else. Sometimes it's something entirely outside your control. The sheet doesn't judge. It reveals.

There is no total score. Your eight attributes are never summed into a single number, because that would imply an optimisation target — and life is not an optimisation problem. The person with the "highest total" is not winning. They might simply be the least honest.

## A Stoic Lens

The ancient Stoics had a useful framework for thinking about the things in your life: some things are *up to you*, and some things are not. Your choices, your effort, your character, your responses — these are yours. Your health, your reputation, your wealth, whether others love you back — these are influenced by your actions but never fully within your control.

Look at the eight attributes through this lens and a pattern emerges. Mind, Spirit, Discipline, and Resilience are closest to what the Stoics called *virtue* — the things that are genuinely yours, that no external event can fully take from you. Body, Standing, and Joy are what they called *preferred indifferents* — things worth pursuing, things that make life better, but things that fate can disrupt at any moment. Heart sits in the middle: you can choose to love, to give, to show up for people — but you cannot control whether they do the same.

This matters for how you relate to your scores. A health crisis can devastate your Body score regardless of how well you've lived. A market crash can tank your Wealth. A bereavement can reshape your Heart and Joy overnight. The Stoic insight is not that these things don't matter — they do, profoundly. It's that the measure of a life well-lived is not your scores, but how you respond to them. Can you face a low number with honesty rather than denial? Can you hold a high number with gratitude rather than entitlement? Can you look at the whole sheet — the strong and the weak, the earned and the given — and say: *this is where I am, and I'm going to keep playing?*

That's the infinite game. Not winning. Playing well.

## How It Works

### The 1–20 Scale

Every score on your Character Sheet uses the same scale. This is deliberate — it gives you a common language to compare across very different areas of your life.

Here's how to interpret the numbers:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1–4 | **Critical.** This area of your life is in serious difficulty. It likely causes you significant distress or impairment, and probably affects other areas too. |
| 5–7 | **Struggling.** Noticeably below where you'd want to be. You're aware this is a weak spot, and it takes effort to manage. |
| 8–9 | **Below average.** Not in crisis, but not where most people are. There's clear room for improvement. |
| 10–11 | **Average.** Roughly where most people land. Functional, unremarkable, neither a source of pride nor concern. |
| 12–13 | **Above average.** A genuine area of competence or satisfaction. You're doing better than most here. |
| 14–15 | **Strong.** A real strength. This area of your life is going well and you likely know it. |
| 16–17 | **Excellent.** Meaningfully above the norm. Other people probably notice and may comment on it. |
| 18–19 | **Exceptional.** Among the best you could realistically hope for. A defining feature of your life. |
| 20 | **Legendary.** The highest realistic level. Almost no one sustains a 20 in any area indefinitely. If you're giving yourself a 20, make sure you're being honest — this should mean you genuinely cannot imagine this area of your life being meaningfully better. |

A few principles to keep in mind:

**10 is not a failing grade.** Average is where most people are, by definition. A life full of 10s is a normal, functional life. The goal isn't to max out every stat — it's to understand your profile.

**Nobody has 20s across the board.** Life involves trade-offs. Exceptional career standing often comes at the cost of relationships or health. Deep spiritual practice may coexist with modest material wealth. Your character sheet should reflect these trade-offs honestly. If all your scores are above 15, you're probably not being honest enough.

**These scores move.** Unlike a tabletop RPG, your attributes aren't fixed. They change with your circumstances, your effort, your age, and plain luck. The Character Sheet is designed to be revisited — weekly, monthly, whenever you feel a shift. Tracking change over time is where the real insight lives.

## The Eight Core Attributes

Your character is defined by eight core attributes. Each one represents a fundamental dimension of a human life. Together, they form a complete picture — not of who you want to be, but of who you are.

Each attribute has a set of sub-scores: more specific facets that help you think carefully about what's driving your overall rating. You don't need to formally score every sub-score (though you can). Their purpose is to prompt honest reflection. You might feel your Body is a solid 13, but when you look at the sub-scores and realise your Rest is a 5, you'll understand your number differently.

---

### 1. Body `#7B6B8D`
*Your physical self — health, capability, and energy.*

Your Body score reflects the overall state of your physical existence. It's not about how you look. It's about how your body serves you: whether it's healthy, capable, energetic, and well-rested.

**Sub-scores:**

- **Health** — Are you free from illness and injury? How are your chronic conditions managed? When did you last feel genuinely unwell?
- **Strength** — Raw physical capability. Can you lift, carry, push, pull? Do you feel physically powerful or physically weak?
- **Agility** — Flexibility, coordination, balance. Can you move with control and grace, or do you feel stiff and clumsy?
- **Stamina** — Cardiovascular endurance. Could you run for a bus without distress? Walk all day? How quickly do you recover from exertion?
- **Vitality** — Your day-to-day energy levels. Do you wake up ready to go, or do you drag yourself through the day? This is the subjective feeling of physical aliveness.
- **Rest** — Sleep quality and recovery. Are you getting enough sleep? Is it good sleep? Do you allow yourself downtime, or are you always running on empty?

**When scoring Body, ask yourself:** If a doctor who knew everything about my physical state gave me an honest rating, what would they say?

---

### 2. Mind `#4A7C8C`
*Your mental life — clarity, emotional health, and intellectual engagement.*

Your Mind score captures how well your inner world is functioning. This includes your cognitive sharpness, your emotional regulation, your psychological wellbeing, and your engagement with learning and ideas. A high Mind score doesn't mean you're a genius — it means your mental life is healthy, active, and well-managed.

**Sub-scores:**

- **Mental Health** — Your overall psychological wellbeing. Are you free from significant depression, anxiety, or other mental health difficulties? Do you feel psychologically stable?
- **Clarity** — Can you think clearly? Focus when you need to? Make decisions without excessive confusion or fog?
- **Emotional Regulation** — How well do you manage your emotional responses? Can you feel things without being overwhelmed by them? Do your emotions serve you or control you?
- **Learning** — Are you growing intellectually? Reading, studying, exploring new ideas? Or have you stagnated?
- **Creativity** — Are you generating ideas, making things, expressing yourself? Creativity isn't just art — it's any act of bringing something new into the world.

**When scoring Mind, ask yourself:** How is my inner world? Is it a place of clarity and growth, or confusion and distress?

---

### 3. Spirit `#8C6B4A`
*Your relationship with meaning, purpose, and your own character.*

Spirit is the deepest attribute. It reflects whether you feel your life has direction and meaning, whether you live with integrity, and whether you've made peace with being the person you are. This isn't necessarily about religion — though for some people it will be. It's about the foundational questions: Why am I here? Am I living in a way I respect? Can I accept myself as I am while still wanting to grow?

**Sub-scores:**

- **Purpose** — Do you have a sense of direction? Do you know what you're working toward, or does life feel aimless?
- **Integrity** — Are you living according to your values? Is there alignment between what you believe and how you act?
- **Self-Acceptance** — How do you relate to your own flaws and limitations? Can you look at yourself honestly without either self-aggrandisement or self-loathing?
- **Gratitude** — Do you appreciate what you have, or are you always focused on what's missing?
- **Practice** — Do you have a regular practice that nourishes your spirit? This could be meditation, prayer, journaling, time in nature, or anything else that connects you to something larger than your daily concerns. Score this based on whether you have and maintain a practice, not whether you feel you should.

**When scoring Spirit, ask yourself:** Do I feel like my life means something? Am I at peace with who I am?

---

### 4. Heart `#8C4A5A`
*Your connections — love, belonging, and generosity.*

Heart captures the relational dimension of your life. Humans are social creatures, and the quality of our relationships is one of the strongest predictors of both happiness and longevity. This attribute asks: Are you loved? Do you love? Are you connected to others in ways that sustain you?

**Sub-scores:**

- **Partner** — The quality of your romantic relationship, if you have one. If you don't, this can reflect your peace with that situation or your pursuit of partnership. A single person who feels content and open scores higher than someone in a relationship that's making them miserable.
- **Family** — The quality of your family relationships. Closeness, warmth, support, communication. This includes whatever family means to you — biological, chosen, or both.
- **Friendships** — Do you have close friends? Real ones, not just acquaintances? Do you see them, talk to them, feel known by them?
- **Community** — Do you belong to something beyond your immediate circle? A neighbourhood, a team, a congregation, a group of regulars, a professional community?
- **Giving** — Generosity, charity, and service to others. This isn't about how much money you donate — it's about whether giving is part of your life. Do you contribute to others' wellbeing?

**When scoring Heart, ask yourself:** If I needed help at 3am, who would I call? How long is that list? And would I answer their call?

---

### 5. Standing `#6B7A4A`
*Your place in the world — career, wealth, reputation, and home.*

Standing reflects how the external world sees you and what you've built in material terms. This is the most outward-facing attribute. It's not about vanity — it's about recognising that where you live, what you earn, how your career is going, and what others think of you all affect your quality of life, whether or not you think they should.

**Sub-scores:**

- **Career** — Are you satisfied with your professional life? Are you progressing, engaged, valued? Or are you stuck, bored, or dreading Monday?
- **Wealth** — Your financial position. Not just income, but net worth, security, trajectory. Can you handle an unexpected expense? Are you building toward financial goals?
- **Reputation** — How do others perceive you, both professionally and personally? Do people respect you? Trust you? Seek your opinion?
- **Home** — The quality of your living situation. Do you like where you live? Does your home feel like a haven or a source of stress?

**When scoring Standing, ask yourself:** Would I be comfortable if a journalist profiled my life? Not because it's impressive — but because it's solid?

---

### 6. Resilience `#4A6B7A`
*Your capacity to withstand adversity and recover from setbacks.*

Resilience is different from every other attribute because it only reveals itself under pressure. You might think your Resilience is high when life is going well — but you don't really know until something goes wrong. This attribute asks you to honestly assess: When life hits me, how do I respond? And how do I know? Look at the evidence from the last time things got hard.

**Sub-scores:**

- **Adversity Tolerance** — How well do you cope when things go wrong? Do you hold together, or do you fall apart?
- **Recovery** — When you do get knocked down, how quickly do you get back up? Days? Weeks? Months? Are you still carrying damage from something that happened years ago?
- **Adaptability** — How well do you handle change? New circumstances, unexpected pivots, plans falling through? Do you adjust, or do you cling to what was?
- **Grit** — Your ability to persist toward long-term goals despite obstacles. This is different from Discipline (which is about daily follow-through). Grit is about years-long commitment in the face of difficulty.

**When scoring Resilience, ask yourself:** Think about the last truly difficult thing that happened to you. How did you handle it? What does that tell you?

---

### 7. Discipline `#5A5A6B`
*Your ability to do what you intend to do.*

Discipline is the engine that turns intention into action. You can have brilliant goals, deep motivation, and a clear plan — and still fail because you can't consistently execute. This attribute is about the gap between what you plan to do and what you actually do. It's the most honest stat on the sheet, because you can't fool yourself: either you did the thing, or you didn't.

**Sub-scores:**

- **Habits** — Do you have consistent daily routines? Do you maintain them, or do they collapse after a few weeks?
- **Follow-Through** — Do you finish what you start? When you make a commitment — to yourself or others — do you honour it?
- **Impulse Control** — Can you resist short-term temptation in service of long-term goals? Can you say no to the thing that feels good now but hurts you later?
- **Time Management** — Do you use your time effectively? Do you know where your hours go? Is there a gap between how you spend your time and how you wish you spent it?

**When scoring Discipline, ask yourself:** If I made a list of everything I said I'd do this month, what percentage did I actually do?

---

### 8. Joy `#8C7A4A`
*Whether you're actually enjoying your life.*

Joy is the attribute most people forget to check. You can be healthy, successful, disciplined, resilient, loved, and purposeful — and still not be having a good time. Joy asks the simplest and most important question: Are you enjoying this? Not in a hedonistic, pleasure-seeking way, but in the full sense: do you experience genuine delight, playfulness, laughter, and engagement in your daily life?

**Sub-scores:**

- **Pleasure** — Do you enjoy the simple things? Food, music, sunlight, a comfortable chair? Are your senses alive, or has everything gone flat?
- **Play** — Do you have fun? Do you do things purely because they're enjoyable, with no productive purpose? When did you last do something silly?
- **Humour** — Do you laugh? Can you be light about things? Is there room for absurdity in your life, or is everything deadly serious?
- **Flow** — Do you experience states of deep engagement, where you lose track of time because you're absorbed in what you're doing?
- **Savouring** — Do you slow down enough to actually appreciate good moments while they're happening, or do you always rush to the next thing?

**When scoring Joy, ask yourself:** When did I last feel genuinely delighted? How long ago was that? And what does that tell me?

---

## Abilities

Your abilities are the specific skills, competencies, and pursuits that make you *you*. While your core attributes describe who you are in general terms, your abilities capture what you can actually do.

### How Abilities Work

Every ability has three properties:

**A Name.** Whatever the ability is. Golf. Cooking. Python Programming. Negotiation. Parenting. Public Speaking. Watercolour Painting. There are no restrictions — if it's something you can do, it's an ability.

**A Score (1–20).** Self-rated, using the same scale as your core attributes. A 10 means average competence — you're about as good as a typical person who does this thing. A 15 means you're genuinely skilled. A 20 means world-class. Be honest.

**A Linked Attribute.** Each ability connects to one or two of your eight core attributes — whichever ones feel most relevant to that ability. Golf might link to Body and Joy. Writing might link to Mind and Discipline. Leadership might link to Heart and Standing. This connection doesn't affect your scores mechanically, but it helps you see patterns. If all your highest abilities link to Mind and none link to Heart, that's telling you something.

### Active vs. Dormant

Every ability is either **Active** (you're currently practising it) or **Dormant** (you have the skill but aren't using it). A dormant ability isn't gone — but it's not contributing to your life right now. Noticing which abilities have gone dormant can be revealing.

### Choosing Your Abilities

There's no master list. You define your own. But here are some questions to get you started:

- What would people who know you well say you're good at?
- What do you spend your time doing? (Both professionally and personally.)
- What could you teach someone?
- What did you used to do that you've let slip?
- What are you actively trying to get better at?

Most people will have somewhere between 5 and 15 abilities on their sheet. Fewer than 5 and you're probably being too modest. More than 20 and you're probably listing things that don't really matter to you.

## Personality: The Big Five

Your core attributes measure where you are in life. Your personality measures how you tend to move through it. The Character Sheet includes a brief personality assessment based on the Big Five model — the most validated and widely used framework in personality psychology.

The Big Five (also called OCEAN) captures five broad dimensions:

**Openness** — Your appetite for novelty, ideas, art, and experience. High scorers are curious, imaginative, and drawn to variety. Low scorers prefer the familiar, the practical, and the concrete.

**Conscientiousness** — Your tendency toward organisation, discipline, and thoroughness. High scorers are reliable, systematic, and goal-directed. Low scorers are more spontaneous and flexible, but may struggle with follow-through.

**Extraversion** — Your orientation toward the outer world. High scorers are sociable, energetic, and talkative. Low scorers (introverts) are more reserved and prefer quieter, less stimulating environments.

**Agreeableness** — Your orientation toward others. High scorers are trusting, cooperative, and empathetic. Low scorers are more competitive, skeptical, and direct.

**Neuroticism** — Your tendency to experience negative emotions. High scorers are more prone to anxiety, sadness, and emotional volatility. Low scorers are more emotionally stable and even-keeled.

The Character Sheet uses the BFI-10 (Rammstedt & John, 2007), a validated 10-item instrument. It's brief — just ten statements rated on a 1–5 scale — but it captures the broad strokes of your personality with reasonable accuracy.

Your personality scores are different from your attributes in an important way: they describe tendencies, not achievements. There is no "good" or "bad" personality profile. High Neuroticism isn't a problem to fix — it's a feature of how you experience the world, and understanding it helps you work with your nature rather than against it.

---

## Reading Your Sheet

Once you've filled in your Character Sheet, step back and look at the whole picture. Here are some things to notice:

**Your profile shape.** If you plotted your eight core attributes on a radar chart, what shape would it make? A balanced octagon? A lopsided star? There's no ideal shape — but the shape tells a story about your life and what you've prioritised.

**Your highs and lows.** What's your highest attribute? Your lowest? The gap between them is often where the tension in your life lives. A person with Body 17 and Heart 6 is living a very different life from someone with Heart 17 and Body 6.

**Clusters.** Do your strong attributes cluster together? High Body/Discipline/Standing might suggest someone who's built an impressive external life. High Spirit/Heart/Joy might suggest someone who's found inner peace but perhaps at the cost of worldly ambition. Neither is better — but noticing the pattern is the point.

**Sub-score surprises.** Your overall attribute score might feel fine, but a sub-score might be screaming for attention. Body 14 with Rest 4 is a time bomb. Heart 15 with Friendships 6 might mean you're over-relying on your partner. The sub-scores are where the nuance lives.

**Dormant abilities.** What have you stopped doing? Was it a conscious choice, or did it just happen? Some of the most important insights come from noticing what you've let go of.

---

## A Final Note

The Character Sheet isn't a diagnostic tool. It doesn't tell you what to do. It tells you where you are. What you do with that information is up to you.

Some people will look at their sheet and feel motivated to work on their weakest attribute. Others will decide to double down on their strengths. Some will realise they've been neglecting Joy in pursuit of Standing, or sacrificing Rest in service of Discipline. Some will simply feel seen — perhaps for the first time — by a portrait of themselves that's both honest and complete.

Whatever your response, the sheet has done its job if it made you think — really think — about the life you're living.

Remember: this is an infinite game. You don't fill in your character sheet once and file it away. You come back to it — next month, next season, after a crisis, after a triumph. The numbers will change. Some will rise because you worked on them. Some will fall through no fault of your own. The sheet grows more valuable with each revision, because the portrait becomes richer, and because the act of honest self-assessment, repeated over time, is itself a kind of practice.

The Stoics believed that the evening review — looking back on the day and asking *how did I do?* — was one of the most important habits a person could cultivate. The Character Sheet is that review, writ large. Not daily, but regularly. Not punitive, but honest. Not a judgement, but an invitation to keep playing well.

The game continues. It always does. But now, at least, you've seen your character sheet.
